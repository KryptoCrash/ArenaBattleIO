WELCOME! To Arena Battle!
Currently, we're in the process of making a game I'm sure MANY people will love, 
and it will be made with phaser 3 which is without a doubt very good.

There will be many classes to choose from and use! Master all the classes, and destroy your enemies!
This game is simple. You pick a person. The person has weapons.
There are other people. With other weapons.

Smack the other person enough, they die.
Victory Royale!

Very simple game mechanics, and beautiful HD graphics that will forsure suit your tastes.

If you don't like it, Make an issue! Tell us why you didn't like it! Not something simple, like:
"WAHHH your game is trash lol fortnuts bttr"

Be specific!
"Your game lacks decent graphics, the movement mechanics suck, there's tons of lag, it eats up memory like you developers 
eat document.cookies, and it gives a trash user experience."

Thank you! =D
